## Tableau Essentials

Curt Frye opens the door to Tableau as if guiding you through a studio built for data storytellers. The course moves at a deliberate pace, showing how raw tables become clean, workable material, and how workable material becomes visual form. You’re introduced to the quiet craft of connecting to disparate data sources, shaping them with intention, and preparing them for analysis that actually reveals something.

As the lessons unfold, simple charts evolve into expressive visualizations, then into layered dashboards and maps that feel tailored for real-world decisions. Calculated fields and parameters stop being abstract features and start behaving like tools in a sculptor’s kit, helping you carve meaning out of complexity. Features like highlights, trendlines, and reference lines become subtle devices for calling attention to the stories hidden inside the numbers.

Chart by chart, map by map, the course shows how thoughtful customization sharpens insight and refines communication. The hands-on examples push you to think not only about accuracy but about clarity, pacing, emphasis, and narrative flow. By the end, Tableau stops being a software package and begins to feel like a medium for influence, where well-designed dashboards draw stakeholders in rather than overwhelm them.

Completing the course leaves you with the ability to build dashboards that are both informative and visually composed, structures that illuminate rather than obscure.
