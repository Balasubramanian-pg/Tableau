Yes, you absolutely can do this, and you are spot on—this is a perfect use case for Python.

However, there is no "official" API (like the Document API) that lets you move layout containers around. To do this, you have to use Python to **hack the raw XML of the Tableau Workbook (`.twb`)**.

A Tableau workbook is just a giant XML file. Every visual, container, and text box is a `<zone>` tag with `x`, `y`, `h`, (height) and `w` (width) attributes.

Here is the exact strategy to align your Navigation Bar across 5 dashboards using Python.

### The Prerequisites
1.  **Use Floating Objects:** This script works best if your Navigation Bar is **Floating**. Tiled containers use complex relative sizing logic that is very hard to edit programmatically without breaking the dashboard.
2.  **Name Your Item:** In Tableau Desktop, go to the **Layout** pane (Item Hierarchy), find your Navigation container, and rename it to something specific, like `Global_Nav_Bar`. Do this on all 5 dashboards.
3.  **Save as .twb:** Save your workbook as a `.twb` (not `.twbx`). If you have a `.twbx`, unzip it first.

### The Python Solution

This script will take the coordinates from the Nav Bar on your **first** dashboard (the "Master") and copy them exactly to the Nav Bars on all other dashboards.

#### Step 1: Install Python XML Library
You don't need `pandas` or `tableau-api-lib`. You just need Python's built-in XML parser.

#### Step 2: The Script

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

# CONFIGURATION
# ---------------------------------------------------------
FILE_PATH = 'MyDashboard.twb'       # Your workbook file
OUTPUT_PATH = 'MyDashboard_Aligned.twb'
NAV_NAME = 'Global_Nav_Bar'         # The exact name you gave the item in Tableau Layout
# ---------------------------------------------------------

def align_dashboards():
    print(f"Parsing {FILE_PATH}...")
    tree = ET.parse(FILE_PATH)
    root = tree.getroot()

    # Dictionary to store the 'Master' coordinates
    master_coords = {}
    found_master = False

    # 1. Find the Master Coordinates (from the first time we see the object)
    # We look inside <dashboards> -> <dashboard> -> <zones> -> <zone>
    for dashboard in root.findall('.//dashboard'):
        # In XML, the user-defined name often appears in the 'name' attribute 
        # But depending on version, sometimes it's mapped via ID. 
        # Standard Tableau XML usually puts the custom name in the 'name' attribute of the zone.
        
        for zone in dashboard.findall('.//zone'):
            # Check if this zone has our specific name
            if zone.get('name') == NAV_NAME:
                print(f"Found Master '{NAV_NAME}' in dashboard: {dashboard.get('name')}")
                
                # Capture the attributes
                master_coords['x'] = zone.get('x')
                master_coords['y'] = zone.get('y')
                master_coords['w'] = zone.get('w')
                master_coords['h'] = zone.get('h')
                found_master = True
                break # Stop searching the first dashboard once found
        
        if found_master:
            break

    if not found_master:
        print(f"Error: Could not find any object named '{NAV_NAME}'. Check your spelling in the Layout pane.")
        return

    print(f"Master Coords Captured: {master_coords}")

    # 2. Apply Master Coordinates to all other instances
    count = 0
    for dashboard in root.findall('.//dashboard'):
        for zone in dashboard.findall('.//zone'):
            if zone.get('name') == NAV_NAME:
                # Update attributes
                zone.set('x', master_coords['x'])
                zone.set('y', master_coords['y'])
                zone.set('w', master_coords['w'])
                zone.set('h', master_coords['h'])
                count += 1
                print(f"Updated '{NAV_NAME}' on dashboard: {dashboard.get('name')}")

    # 3. Save the file
    tree.write(OUTPUT_PATH, encoding='utf-8', xml_declaration=True)
    print(f"Success! Updated {count} instances. Saved as {OUTPUT_PATH}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    align_dashboards()
```

### How to use this:

1.  **Prepare Tableau:** Open your workbook. Click on your Navigation container. Go to the **Layout** tab on the left. Rename the item (it usually says "Vertical Container" or "Image") to `Global_Nav_Bar`. Repeat this for all 5 dashboards.
2.  **Position the First One:** Manually set the X, Y, W, H of the Nav Bar on the **first** dashboard to be exactly what you want.
3.  **Save:** Save as `.twb`.
4.  **Run Script:** Run the Python script above.
5.  **Open Result:** Open `MyDashboard_Aligned.twb`. You will see the Nav Bar has jumped to the exact same pixel position on every single dashboard.

### Why this works
Tableau XML stores coordinates as integers (usually out of 100,000 for relative scaling or raw pixels for fixed dashboards). By copying the raw XML string from the "correct" one to the "others," you bypass the need to calculate pixels manually.

### Warning
*   **Always Backup:** XML hacking is powerful but if you delete a tag by accident, the workbook won't open.
*   **Grouped Items:** If your Nav Bar contains multiple buttons, **Group them** into one "Container" in Tableau first, and rename that Container. Move the Container, not the individual buttons.
