# Auto-complete limitations

Canonical documentation for Auto-complete limitations. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

Auto-complete limitations exist to address the class of problems related to the constraints and boundaries of auto-complete functionality in various applications, such as text editors, search bars, and form fields. The primary purpose is to provide a clear understanding of what auto-complete can and cannot do, helping developers and users alike to avoid misunderstandings and incorrect assumptions about its capabilities. When auto-complete limitations are misunderstood or inconsistently applied, risks and failures can arise, such as decreased user experience, incorrect data entry, and increased error rates. For instance, if an auto-complete feature is not properly limited, it may suggest inappropriate or irrelevant options, leading to user frustration and potential security vulnerabilities.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of auto-complete limitations consists of three major components: 
1. **Data Source**: The repository of data from which auto-complete suggestions are generated.
2. **Algorithm**: The set of rules and processes that filter and rank suggestions based on user input.
3. **User Interface**: The presentation layer where suggestions are displayed to the user.

These components interact to produce a list of relevant suggestions that help users complete their input efficiently. The model is designed to balance suggestion accuracy, response time, and user experience, ensuring that auto-complete functionality is both helpful and non-intrusive.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

Clarify the explicit boundaries of this documentation.

**In scope:**
* Conceptual model of auto-complete limitations
* Terminology and definitions related to auto-complete functionality
* Standard usage patterns and best practices

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of auto-complete
* Vendor-specific behavior and customizations
* Operational or procedural guidance for deploying auto-complete features

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Auto-complete | A feature that predicts and suggests completions for partially entered text or other input. |
| Suggestion | A proposed completion for user input, generated by an auto-complete algorithm. |
| Data Source | The collection of data used to generate auto-complete suggestions. |
| Algorithm | The set of rules and processes that filter and rank suggestions based on user input. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Data Source
The data source is the foundation of auto-complete functionality, providing the pool of potential suggestions. Its quality, relevance, and size directly impact the effectiveness of the auto-complete feature.

### 5.2 Algorithm
The algorithm is responsible for processing user input and generating a list of relevant suggestions. It must balance factors such as suggestion accuracy, response time, and user interface constraints.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The data source, algorithm, and user interface interact to produce a seamless auto-complete experience. Constraints such as data privacy, security, and performance must be considered to ensure that the auto-complete feature is both useful and respectful of user boundaries.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for auto-complete limitations involves a tiered approach, where suggestions are generated based on a combination of factors, including user input, data source relevance, and algorithmic ranking. The model also considers constraints such as data privacy and security to ensure that suggestions are both accurate and appropriate.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that:
- The data source is relevant and up-to-date.
- The algorithm is efficient and effective in generating suggestions.
- The user interface is intuitive and responsive.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true within the standard model:
- Suggestions are generated based on user input.
- Suggestions are ranked according to relevance and accuracy.
- The auto-complete feature respects user boundaries and constraints.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern A: Incremental Suggestion
- **Intent:** Provide suggestions as the user types, incrementally refining the list based on input.
- **Context:** Real-time search, form completion, and text editing.
- **Tradeoffs:** Balances suggestion accuracy with response time and user interface responsiveness.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Overly Broad Suggestions
- **Description:** Generating suggestions that are too general or irrelevant to the user's input.
- **Failure Mode:** Frustrates users with unnecessary or confusing suggestions.
- **Common Causes:** Poorly designed algorithms or inadequate data source filtering.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

Examples include handling special characters, non-standard input formats, and suggestions that span multiple data sources.
