# Why relationships sometimes underperform

Canonical documentation for Why relationships sometimes underperform. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

Relationships are a fundamental aspect of human experience, and their performance can have a significant impact on an individual's well-being and happiness. However, relationships sometimes underperform, leading to dissatisfaction, conflict, and even dissolution. This topic exists to explore the reasons behind underperforming relationships, the class of problems they address, and the risks or failures that arise when they are misunderstood or inconsistently applied. The risks of underperforming relationships include emotional distress, decreased mental and physical health, and strained social connections. When relationships are not functioning optimally, individuals may experience feelings of isolation, disconnection, and unhappiness, which can have far-reaching consequences for their overall quality of life.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of underperforming relationships consists of several major components, including communication, emotional intelligence, conflict resolution, and intimacy. These components interact and influence one another, producing outcomes such as relationship satisfaction, commitment, and longevity. The model is designed to produce a deeper understanding of the complex factors that contribute to underperforming relationships and to provide a framework for identifying and addressing these issues.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The scope of this documentation includes:

**In scope:**
* Theoretical frameworks for understanding relationship dynamics
* Factors that contribute to underperforming relationships
* Strategies for improving relationship performance

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., couples therapy techniques)
* Vendor-specific behavior (e.g., specific counseling approaches)
* Operational or procedural guidance (e.g., step-by-step instructions for improving relationships)

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

The following terms are used throughout this document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Communication
Communication is the foundation of any successful relationship. Effective communication involves active listening, clear expression of thoughts and feelings, and a willingness to negotiate and compromise. Poor communication can lead to misunderstandings, conflict, and feelings of disconnection.

### 5.2 Emotional Intelligence
Emotional intelligence is critical for building and maintaining strong, healthy relationships. It involves being able to recognize and understand emotions in oneself and others, and to use this awareness to guide thought and behavior. Emotional intelligence helps partners to navigate conflicts, manage stress, and maintain a positive emotional climate in the relationship.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The core concepts of communication, emotional intelligence, conflict resolution, and intimacy interact and influence one another in complex ways. For example, effective communication is essential for building emotional intelligence, while emotional intelligence is necessary for effective conflict resolution. The constraints of time, energy, and resources can also impact the quality of relationships, as partners may struggle to balance the demands of work, family, and other responsibilities with the needs of the relationship.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model of underperforming relationships involves a dynamic interplay between communication, emotional intelligence, conflict resolution, and intimacy. The model suggests that relationships are more likely to underperform when one or more of these components is lacking or impaired.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that relationships are complex systems that involve multiple interacting components, and that the performance of the relationship is influenced by the interactions and interdependencies between these components.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true within the standard model:

* Relationships involve emotional investment and interdependence
* Effective communication is essential for building and maintaining strong relationships
* Emotional intelligence is critical for navigating conflicts and managing stress

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: The Pursuer-Distancer Pattern
- **Intent:** To understand and address the dynamics of pursuit and distance in relationships
- **Context:** When one partner is pursuing intimacy and connection, while the other is distancing or pulling away
- **Tradeoffs:** This pattern can help partners to recognize and address underlying issues, but it can also create feelings of frustration and resentment if not managed effectively

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A: The Blame Game
- **Description:** A pattern of behavior in which one or both partners blame each other for the problems in the relationship
- **Failure Mode:** This pattern can lead to defensiveness, hurt feelings, and a breakdown in communication
- **Common Causes:** This pattern can arise when partners are not taking responsibility for their own actions and emotions, or when they are not communicating effectively

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

### The Impact of Trauma on Relationships
Relationships involving partners who have experienced trauma may require special consideration and care. Trauma can affect a partner's ability to trust, communicate, and form intimate connections, and it can also impact the overall dynamics of the relationship.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
