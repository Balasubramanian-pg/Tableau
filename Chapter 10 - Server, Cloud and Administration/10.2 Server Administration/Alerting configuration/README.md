# Alerting configuration

## Alerting configuration in Tableau Cloud

### Key Points

* Tableau Cloud uses Data-Driven Alerts to notify users when data points cross a specified threshold.
* The system sends notifications either as an email, as an alert on the Tableau site, or through a connected Slack workspace.
* A user must select a continuous numeric axis on a chart to create a Data-Driven Alert; discrete axes and map visualizations are not supported.
* Site administrators control Data-Driven Alert settings for the entire site and manage extract refresh failure notifications.

### Definitions

* **Data-Driven Alert (DDA):** A mechanism that automatically sends a notification when a data value in a published view or dashboard crosses a pre-set threshold.
* **Continuous Numeric Axis:** A graphic element on a chart that displays numeric values along an uninterrupted scale. It forms the basis for setting the alert's threshold value.
* **Subscription:** A scheduled email that sends a snapshot of a view or workbook at a regular interval, irrespective of the data values within it.

### Core Concepts

* **Alert Condition Types**
    * Data-Driven Alerts support conditions that trigger the notification when data is *above*, *below*, *equal*, *above-equal*, or *below-equal* to the threshold value.
    * Users set the frequency for checking the data condition (e.g., once, hourly, daily, weekly).
* **System Notifications**
    * These cover background processes, such as extract refresh failures.
    * The system can send notifications for server health monitoring, including server process events (up, down, failover) and drive space threshold warnings.
* **Alert Visibility**
    * An alert can be set as *private* (only the creator sees it) or *public* (any user with permissions for the worksheet can see it and add themselves as a recipient).

### Process or Steps

1.  **Select a Chart Element:** Open the view or dashboard and select a continuous numeric axis on a non-Gantt or non-map chart. This action opens the Alerts side panel.
2.  **Define the Threshold:** Select the "Create" option from the Alerts side panel, and set a specific numeric value for the alert threshold. A red line appears on the visualization to indicate where the threshold falls.
3.  **Configure Recipient and Frequency:** Specify the subject line of the notification and set a schedule for how often Tableau should check the data against the threshold. Add the list of recipients who should receive the notification.
4.  **Confirm Alert Creation:** Select "Create Alert" to activate the monitoring process.

### Examples

* **Simple Data Change:** A daily alert is set on a line chart to notify the sales team when the `Sum of Sales` value rises above a value of $14,000.
* **Conditional Alert:** An alert is created on a calculated field that returns a value of `1` only if the `Profit Ratio` is less than zero AND the `Returns Rate` is above a 6% rate. The alert threshold is set to `1`.
* **Process Failure Alert:** A site administrator enables email notifications to be sent to the data source owner when a scheduled extract refresh task fails.

### Common Mistakes

* Setting an alert on a field that is *discrete* (such as a Count of Customers) rather than a *continuous measure*, which Tableau does not support for this feature.
* Creating an alert on a worksheet and then renaming or deleting the underlying view, which causes the alert to fail and potentially be suspended.
* Failing to check for suspended alerts in the **My Content** area after changes to a dashboard, which stops notifications even if the threshold is crossed.

### Reference Facts

* Tableau Pulse offers its own alert system that works with metrics, separately from Data-Driven Alerts.
* Alerts that fail consistently are suspended to preserve system resources. Administrators or alert owners can resume a suspended alert from the Tasks > Alerts area.
* A data-driven alert can be configured using the Tableau REST API by sending a POST request to the `/api/api-version/sites/site-luid/dataAlerts` endpoint.

### Thought Process (Condensed)

The notes were generated by extracting information about Data-Driven Alerts, system notifications, and administrative controls from the search results. Content was organized into the nine required sections from the template. The steps for the Process section focus on the most common user action, Data-Driven Alert creation. All banned vocabulary was avoided. ASSUMPTION: The search results from Tableau Help documentation reflect the current configuration practices for Tableau Cloud as of December 2025.

### Verification Notes

* Items that likely required external checks: current platform configuration details, API endpoints, and failure thresholds, as these can change after June 2024.
* Items uncertain now: The exact failure threshold for alert suspension on Tableau Cloud. The search result of 350 consecutive failures is documented for Tableau Server, but the concept of suspension is true for both.
* Items that do not apply: File access or environment permissions.
