Below is a structured explanation of the **different Row Level Security (RLS) methods available in Tableau Server** and how they are typically used.

### Overview of Row Level Security in Tableau

Row Level Security (RLS) restricts which rows of data a given user can see in a workbook or data source on Tableau Server. RLS is separate from Tableau **permissions**, which control access to content but do not filter the underlying data itself. ([Tableau Help][1])

### Core RLS Methods

#### 1. User Filters with Manual Mapping

**Description**

* A filter is created where specific Tableau Server users are manually mapped to allowed field values (for example a region or department).
* When a workbook is published with this filter, each user sees only the rows associated with their mapped values. ([Tableau Help][1])

**Use Cases**

* Small user sets with relatively static roles.
* Quick proof of concept or test scenarios.

**Advantages**

* Simple to understand and implement.

**Limitations**

* High maintenance because mappings must be updated manually as users change.
* Must be applied per workbook or data source. ([Tableau Help][2])

#### 2. Dynamic User Filters Using a Security/Entitlement Field

**Description**

* A calculated field uses functions like `USERNAME()` or `ISMEMBEROF()` to determine a user’s identity or group membership.
* The filter then automatically evaluates whether the current user should see each row, based on attributes stored in the data or a related security table. ([Tableau Help][2])

**Use Cases**

* When there is a table in the data source that links user identity or group to allowed values.
* Organizations that want less manual maintenance than user filters alone.

**Advantages**

* More automated and less error-prone than manual user filters.
* Centralized filtering logic if used across multiple workbooks.

**Limitations**

* Still relies on correctly securing permissions on the published assets. ([Tableau Help][2])

#### 3. RLS via Data Policies on Virtual Connections (Data Management)

**Description**

* Introduced in newer versions of Tableau Server/Tableau Cloud when **Data Management** is enabled.
* Row-level filters are defined as **data policies** on a centralized **virtual connection** rather than individually in each workbook. These policies are enforced at query time for all connections using that virtual connection. ([Tableau Help][1])

**Use Cases**

* Large environments where centralized control of RLS is preferred.
* Teams with a Data Management license who want consistent security across many workbooks.

**Advantages**

* Centralized and reusable across content.
* Safer because policies apply to every query, reducing risk of misconfiguration.

**Limitations**

* Requires Data Management capabilities in Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud. ([Tableau Help][2])

#### 4. Using Existing RLS in the Database

**Description**

* Leverages built-in RLS mechanisms supported by many modern databases (for example SQL Server, Snowflake, etc.).
* Tableau connects live to the database and the database enforces row-level restrictions before Tableau ever receives the data. ([Tableau Help][1])

**Use Cases**

* Organizations that have already implemented RLS in their source systems.
* Scenarios where RLS policies must be shared with other applications beyond Tableau.

**Advantages**

* Security is centralized at the database layer.
* No need to replicate RLS logic within Tableau itself.

**Limitations**

* Must use live connections; extracts cannot enforce database RLS directly. ([Tableau Help][3])

### Summary of Methods

| RLS Method                           | Typical Use Case                             | Maintenance | Centralization              |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Manual User Filters                  | Small user sets, quick setups                | High        | Per workbook                |
| Dynamic User Filters                 | Automated based on data attributes           | Medium      | Per data source or workbook |
| Data Policies on Virtual Connections | Large managed environments                   | Low         | Centralized                 |
| Database-Native RLS                  | Enterprise database security already defined | Low         | At database layer           |

### Short Explanation of Reasoning

This answer was constructed by synthesizing Tableau’s official documentation and other reliable sources on how RLS is implemented in Tableau Server. Each method listed corresponds to a distinct approach supported by the platform, distinguished by where the filtering logic is defined and how it is maintained.
